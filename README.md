## Flood Inundation Mapping & Impacts: Leveraging Google Earth Engine Python API and Spatial Analytics

[![Open In Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/waleedgeo/flood-mapping-workshop/blob/main/flood-mapping-workshop.ipynb)

Welcome to a comprehensive workshop designed to introduce you to the power of Google Earth Engine (GEE) with Python, focusing on its application in large-area flood inundation mapping. This workshop is tailored for researchers who are familiar with GEE's JavaScript API but are new to Python-based Earth Engine.

The workshop is divided into two parts. First is the brief presentation which showcase the basics of flood mapping, and the emergence of Python API for Earth Engine. Then, the 2nd part starts with a gentle introduction to Python fundamentals, bridging the gap from the JavaScript GEE API. Then, it dives into connecting GEE with Python using the `geemap` library, enabling interactive mapping and analysis. The core of the workshop is the part 2 i.e., hands-on session on flood inundation mapping using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, showcasing both a simple change detection approach and a more robust Z-score time series analysis.
