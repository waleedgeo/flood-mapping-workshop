Welcome to a comprehensive workshop designed to introduce you to the power of Google Earth Engine (GEE) with Python, focusing on its application in large-area flood inundation mapping. This workshop is tailored for MPhil, PhDs, and experts who are familiar with GEE's JavaScript API but are new to Python-based Earth Engine.

We will start with a gentle introduction to Python fundamentals, bridging the gap from your JavaScript experience. Then, we'll dive into connecting GEE with Python using the `geemap` library, enabling interactive mapping and analysis. The core of the workshop will be a hands-on session on flood inundation mapping using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, showcasing both a simple change detection approach and a more robust Z-score time series analysis.
